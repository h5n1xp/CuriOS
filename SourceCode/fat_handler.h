//Handlers are actually device structures, as devices can also be their own handlers
//The FAT handler is a file system which needs to be mounted on top of a block device (specified in the dosEntry_t)
//as such it doesn't have any of it's own device features, it is essentially just a library.
//
//
//Handlers are a superset of the device type, if a device can be accessed by DOS it needs to be a handler. if a
//device does not need to be exposed to the file system it doesn't need to be a handler.
